# Image-processing
This Project is conducted using MATLAB.
This project aims to imitate the game Lego’s Life of George, where an image is displayed on the screen for a few seconds
then the player must memorize and reconstruct the Lego blocks as seen in the image. 
Given a set of images with different flaws, such as noise, rotation, and projections, a program was written using MATLAB to fix the images 
and return an array representing the 16 square blocks’ colours as strings and as accurately as possible. 
In this report, images2 were used as the set of images for processing.
